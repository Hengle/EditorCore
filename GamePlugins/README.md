To build a game module make a symlink to it here and add it to the vs solution.
make sure the build path is set to ..\..\EditorCore\bin\Debug\Ext\ or else it won't be automatically loaded by the editor.
Remember to build it manually after every change or enable to always build the whole solution in vs settings.

Example game module : [OdysseyExt](https://github.com/exelix11/OdysseyEditor)
